						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
					</header>
						<h2>Defining the Audience </h2>
						<img src="images\sticky notes.jpg" alt="" class="idk"/>
						<p> I split my audience into 3 groups: Contributors, Those in Need (of help from Barefoot Artists), and audience members that fit into both of those categories. One of the beauties of this organization's projects is that many of the people being helped decide to participate in the creation process and transform themselves along with the public space.  </p>
