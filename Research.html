					<h3> Major Projects </h3>
					<h4> The Village of Arts and Humanities (1986-2004)</h4>
					<p> Park-building project started by Lily Yeh in Northern Pennsylvania; project that launched the founder's career that would eventually lead to Barefoot Artists;created the model that Barefoot Artists now follows by working both within the physical community and with the community's residents. Now has their own <a href="https://villagearts.org/">website</a> and leadership. </p>
					<h4>The Rwanda Healing Project (2004-2014) </h4>
					<p>In response to the 1994 genocide of Tutsi and moderate Hutu sympathizers in Rwanda; Lily Yeh by chance met and empathized with Jean Bosco Musana Rukirande;
						she visited him in Gisenyi to better understand his people's situation (mostly survivors). The two sites shown to her that needed help were a mass grave in Rugerero and a nearby survivor's village.
					Out of this came a two-part project: the Rugerero Genocide Memorial and the transformation of the Rugerero Survivor's Village. These projects symbolize a balance of life and death, the violence of the past
				and hope for the future. Multiple other projects have been pursued and continue to this day, including a short documentary.  </p>
				  <h4> Palestine Project (2011-present)</h4>
					<p>Not much info under "major projects", but under "nablus" (Palestine)(?);
						"A modern city with ancient roots", a city that endured brutal attacks from the occupying Israeli military during the Second Intifada, killing families and destroying buildings. The resulting town
						and their people have earned the nickname "Mountain of Fire." In 2014 Barefoot Artists were invited to make a mural in the townssquare, representing the "resistance fighter."
						They returned in 2015 to restore it after being pockmarked by bullets. They also then transformed the city square and helf workshops for children; brought together a community.</p>
					<h4> The Dandelion School Transformation Project (2007-present)</h4>
					<p>Involves the Dandelion School on the outskirts of Beijing, China, that is polluted and an area of high crime; serves migrant families of low income, but was very inhospitable. Students, teachers, and volunteers came together to transform the school. Two "Mapping" projects that the students were involved in encouraged these migrant children to trace their journey from their homeland to Beijing, expressing their feelings about being in a new environment.
						Lily Yeh along with other artists of this organization painted murals that were inspired by traditional Chinese art and folk art, as well as mosiac programs that deepened the community's respect for cultural heritage. When the school relocated to a larger campus in 2018, Lily Yeh and her team were invited to transform the new campus as well. Students work was later exhibited at a public art show.</p>
					<h4>The Mei Hwa Project (2014-present)</h4>
					<p>Daxi, Taiwan; An Elementary school located in an impoverished town in Taiwan, many children are from indigenous or immigrant families that are low-income. In response to a severe drop in the student body and low popularity Lily Yeh was invited to revitalize the school. Working together with the school's principal and Zizhuo Shi (the sponsor) a creative program was formed that resulted in a three story Tree of Life mural.The creation of the mural faced many
						challenges, but Lily Yeh found inspiration from the strong-willed people of this community that continued to work despite many setbacks. In the second year Barefoot Artists work with the Mei Hwa School the creative program was advanced along with participation from the students and community, earning the school a spot within the top five most innovative educational schools among a nation-wide competition. The third phase of the project involved Lily Yeh involving the students' works directly into her large floor mosaic design created for the school campus.</p>
					<h4> Korogocho, Kenya (1994-2007)</h4>
				<p>	A settlement of 100,000 people located near a city dump site from which residents scavenge for survival. Lily Yeh stayed for a three-month residency, eventually forming a 13-year partnership along with Eliimo and Phillda Njau of the Paa Ya Paa Art Center and Father Alex Zanotelli of St. Johnos Catholic Church in Korogocho. Lily collaborated with visual and performing art groups to encourage the community to participate in creating murals, paintings, mask-making, drama, and sculpture-making. During her first trip, the community came together to transform a barren courtyard. She especially focused on encouraging children in the art-making process. In 2003 Barefoot Artists worked with another local organization called "Education for Life" to create a widespread campaign to warn of the dangers of HIV and AIDS, as well as preventative methods. Along with the creation of banners, a teach-in festival was formed to include multiple forms of art, dance, and theatrics. </p>
				<h4>The Barefoot Artist Documentary </h4>
				<p>Explores the international career of Lily Yeh and the impact of her organization's projects as well as her own personal life

				<h3>Short-term Projects</h3>
			<h4> Gorlitz, Germany (2016)</h4>
			<p> A city with a rich cultural heritage that is now suffering under oppressing communist rule and a lack of employment oppourtunities; the population is dwindling. Barefoot Artists answered a call from a group of local artists to help encourage and inspire creativity and the importance of cultural heritage in order for the city artisans and residents alike to live up to their full potential </p>
			<h4> Urban Alchemy in Milwaukee, Wisconsin</h4>
			<p> A project led by Barefoot Artists that addresses the racial inequality, separation, and poverty prevalent within this community, and the lack of community-led solutions. Through workshops and instillations and a two-phase process led by Urban Alchemy public art was brought to the Holton Street Viaduct. Lily Yeh co-created with artists, residents, children, and volunteers to transform the public space into a beautiful, art-driven park. </p>
			<h4>An Kang Public Housing Project (2013) </h4>
			<p>Located on the outskirts of Taipei; a city that has a concentration of low-income residents, crime and violence, drugs, and an overall lack of a trusting community.The Graduate Institute of Building and Planning of National Taiwan University was set to transform this community and the persons themselves and enlisted Lily Yeh's help. She conducted workshops with a mixed audience ranging from elementary schoolers to elderly residents and struggled to keep everyone's engagement at first. Her continuous efforts that involved encouragement, positive energy, and overall support she was able to overcome these challenges and create a relaxed, fun environment. The project became a very therapuetic exercise for the community. </p>
