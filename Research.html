						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p class="info">This section of the project involved collecting both primary and secondary research. The primary research is pulled from the Barefoot Artists website and its social media pages. Secondary research is taken from other websites, organizations, and interviews.</p>

					<h2>Primary Research</h2>
			<p>	<span class="image left"><img src="images\Screenshot (262).png" alt="Old Barefoot Artists Website"></span>	</p>
				<p><h3>Research from the Barefoot Artists Website</h3></p>
						<p> Barefoot Artists is an international organization that is based in the United States that focuses on improving the local environment of impoverished communities. The organization has worked on numerous projects over 30 years, and each follow a similar pattern: Lily Yeh (the founder) and her team members are either invited or adventure out into areas of certain countries that are in need. Within these communities her team spreads inspiration through documentary of past projects and her team's own art skills, working directly with the community to encourage culturally-inspired art. The process of bringing art into neglected, often broken public spaces creates a significant change not only within the community as a whole but among each individual participant. Barefoot Artists encourages and assists local artists and artisans to pursue their trade in an uplifting way.   </p>

					<h4>An Archival Site</h4>
						<p>After sifting through almost all of the <a href="images\research1.png" target="_blank">projects</a> published by Barefoot Artists, I compiled a basic list of each project and its summary. The main goal of this site is to showcase its history and the art that has come out of its many endeavors. However, the home page does little to direct the audience's attention to its projects pages, many of which are hidden within separate pages. Pictures that showcase the art of each project are often low-quality and put into a "slideshow" that does not function properly. The media gallery only consists of links to videos and podcasts; there is no real photo gallery. While there is lots of good information about each project, the average viewer would not feel called to explore what the site has to offer.</p>

					 <h4>Gaining an Audience </h4>
					 	<p>Barefoot Artists uses social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram to relay information about current events and workshops taking place. While this is a good way to redirect audience members to the website, it is worth noting that these pages have some of what the original website is lacking: clear organization and presentation of their projects. Another goal of this organization is to spread awareness of the communities they've visited as well as the artwork those communities have created. Donations and sponsorships are also an important factor for this organization that the website does not seem to highlight in any particular way. Barefoot Artists also has a published book, a documentary, and a bi-annual newsletter that gains new audience members; if the website was better tailored towards its audience there would be a better retention rate of those visiting the website through those means.

		<h2>Secondary Research </h2>
		<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\Screenshot (238).png" alt="New York Times movie review"></span></p>
		<p>One of the first results for Barefoot Artists is a short New York Times article that focuses on the documentary and Lily Yeh's life as the founder. Another result is a website called The Healing Power of Art; this is how I found out about Barefoot Artists after finding a list on their website of various non-profit art organizations. I also found that the University of Nebraska-Lincoln published an article when Lily Yeh was visiting their campus in 2012, and from there explored where else her team has visited among schools. I found that she and her team have visited <a href="images\research2.png" target="_blank">dozens</a> of other universities and organizations for workshops and presentations, some of which include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Harvard Divinity School </li>
			<li>The ATLAS International Conference, University Babes-Bolyai </li>
			<li>Minneapolis College of Art & Design </li>
			<li>Maine College of Art </li>
			<li>Service International Symposium, Taichung, Taiwan </li>
			<li>National Taidong Art University </li>
			<li>National Museum of Women in the Arts </li>
			<li>TEDxCornell </li>
			<li>40th Annual International AEE Conference </li>
		 </ul>
		 <p><span class="image left"><img src="images\Screenshot (234).png" alt="Interview with Lily Yeh by Urban Milwaukee"></span></p>
		 <h4>Other Features </h4>
		 <p><a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2014/01/10/art-the-barefoot-artist/"> This </a> interview from Urban Milwaukee offers a detailed insight about the meaning and goals behind this organization. Some quotes from the founder within this interview would be very helpful if they could be integrated into the website somehow. This interview probably taught me the most about the deeper meaning behind Barefoot Artists' work. Another helpful <a href="https://www.artforprogress.org/behind-the-barefoot-artist/"> interview by art for progress</a> gave more information about the origins of Barefoot Artists and the personal lives of members from the documentary. </p>
		 <p>The Pennywise Foundation was a past sponsor of Barefoot artists and has information about them on their website. The Rwanda Healing Project by Barefoot Artists is featured on <a href="https://segd.org/">segd.org</a>, an non-profit organization of professionals in many fields, including a community of over 2000 members from 35 countries; holds annual conferences </p>
		 <p><span class="image right"><img src="images\Screenshot (264).png"></span></p>
		 <h4>Similar Organizations and Ideas</h4>
		 <p>The Future History of Public Art, the 17th symposium organized by the Western States Arts Federation (WESTAF), was held in 2017 and asked public art leaders for their thoughts on the future of public art. Many ideas were similar to those in Lily Yeh's interviews: transformation of a space can change the way people see it, and as Lily Yeh says, this will attract more people to help and create viable economy. There was also a general consensus about the transformation that comes from within people themselves, that this is reflected through public art. The Boston Globe recently questioned the purpose of public art, especially within the context of recent times. Both pandemic and the rising popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired art that focuses on the collective experience of a group of people, usually providing signs of hope or understanding as delved into by the
			 <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/03/arts/what-is-public-art-even-new-works-suggest-transformation-culture-shared-space/">article</a>. It also addresses public art that has become the topic of debate in recent news, particularly statues that depict racist figures or ideals. Public art in this sense is quite a hot topic in the news today.

		<h2>Interviews </h2>
		<h3>Client Interview  </h3>
		<p>After contacting Lily Yeh through email, she sent me the contact information of a close friend and coworker of hers named Xueer Jiang. I interviewed her in order to get a better understanding of the goals of their website.  She helped me realize that the priority of this site is to store information in an archival format, though spreading information about their methods and projects seemed to be just as important to her. Her background and personal experience with Lily Yeh was very helpful as she told me her stories. She said that she wouldn't have even known about some of the causes they have catered to (such as the Rwanda Genocide) if it weren't for Barefoot Artists, which told me just how powerful can be. I also learned that one of their most effective ways of getting new audience members is through a bi-annual newsletter that details what projects they have worked on for the year.</p>

		<h3>User Interview </h3>
		<p>Corey Mansfield is a Junior at Anderson University majoring in Painting and Drawing. He is a Christ-follower and believes that giving back to the community is important. He is also a very skilled artist. I learned some interesting facts about what features stand out the most on a website for someone looking to volunteer. He also gave personal preferences when it comes to UI design and affirmation that his peers of any art concentration would be glad to work on public art projects. The idea of a project similar to the ones seen by Barefoot Artists excited him, which helps in determining the possibilities of a younger audience.</p>
