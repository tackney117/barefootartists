						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">Using a worksheet from the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit I first determined the unique design challenges that were facing this website.</p>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\17_Dandelion-I.jpg"></span></p>
					<h3>What is the problem you are trying to solve? </h3>
					<p>The lack of visual heirarchy and organization that prevents users from learning <br>about the organization and making donations. </p>
					<h3>Take a stab at framing it as a design question. </h3>
					<p> How can Barefoot Artists promote their organization in a meaningful and <br>informational way? </p>
					<h3>Now state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have. </h3>
					<p>Further the purpose of the organization by creating a design that will spread information/awareness more efficiently to attract a larger audience. </p>
					<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
					<p>Present the information of the website in a way that prioritizes the projects <br>alongside the communities that created them. Also creating more visual interest through hierarchy and better use of imagery.</p>
					<h3>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing. </h3>
					<p>Some of the constraints I'm facing are actually a good thing: there is a <em>lot</em> of information about this organization and its projects, so it will be hard to prioritize what will attract users the most. </p>
					<h3>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again. </h3>
					<p>How can the re-design of the Barefoot Artists website allow for a wider audience reach that creates a greater impact? </p>
