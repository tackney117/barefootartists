					<h2>What is the problem you are trying to solve? </h2>
					<p>The lack of visual heirarchy and organization that prevents users from learning about the organizations and making donations. </p>
					<h2>Take a stab at framing it as a design question. </h2>
					<p> How can Barefoot Artists promote their organization in a meaningful and informational way? </p>
					<h2>Now state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have. </h2>
					<p>Further the purpose of the organization by creating a design that will spread information/awareness more efficiently to attract a larger audience. </p>
					<h2>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h2>
					<p>Present the information of the website in a way that prioritizes the projects alongside the communities that created them. Also creating more visual interest through hierarchy and better use of imagery.</p>
					<h2>) Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing. </h2>
					<p>Some of the constraints I'm facing are actually a good thing--there is a LOT of information about this organization and a lot of projects that they have worked on, so it will be hard to prioritize what will attract users the most. </p>
					<h2>) Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again. </h2>
					<p>How can the re-design of the Barefoot Artists website allow for a wider audience reach that creates a greater impact? </p>
