						<h1>Solutions</h1>
						<p class="info">After compiling my research I determined the primary and secondary Call to Action. I also designed a style tile that would best represent the overall look and feel of what I want the website to be.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\cta.jpg" alt="call to action buttons labeled our projects and about us"></span></p>
					<p>My main CTA is the “Our Projects” button, placed below the header of the page. I decided this was best considering their main goal is to keep an archive of their projects and showcase them in a way that spreads information about various topics. The projects will also help viewers learn more about the wide range of opportunities that Barefoot Artists has and will continue to provide.</p>
					<p>My secondary CTA is “About Us” in the upper right corner. This CTA is for people who want to get directly to information about organization, not necessarily their projects. This could be people looking for credibility of the organization, ways to donate, or people who simply want to know what it’s about before exploring what the site has to offer. </p>

				<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<p>A style tile is essentially a "glorified moodboard" that includes examples of type, color, and imagery that would be used in a website. This helped me determine the overall look and feel I wanted to establish with my website.</p>
				<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images\styletilejpegREAL.jpg"></span></p>
				<p>For the style tile, I chose adjectives that emphasized the warm, caring, and educational aspects of this organization, and matched the rest of my visual elements with these words. I decided to go for an earthy palette considering how this organization works directly with the environment, and many of the communities affected are close with the natural space around them. I color picked from various photos taken from the website and adjusted them as I saw fit.</p>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\logologo.jpg"></span></p>
				<p>For the typefaces, I chose Book Antiqua to be my serif font that would mostly be used for headers, as it represented a warmer, traditional feeling that my sans-serif could not replicate. I chose Franklin Gothic as my sans-serif because its compact spacing reflected a sense of organization and cleanliness that the original website was lacking, as well as the sense of "togetherness" that reflects a close community.</p>
				<p>The imagery I chose was directly from the organization's gallery. The banner photo works well in a compositional manner, leading the eye from the header and primary CTA to the secondary CTA through implied line. The border around the smaller photo and text represent what an active element tile would look like (border would be activated when hovered over). After looking at various museum websites, I thought that organizing content through the use of tiles would be efficient.</p>
				<p>The redesigned logo was inspired by a lotus flower, as the symbolic meaning of beauty and rebirth arising from unlikely places fits well with the mission of Barefoot Artists. The petals also represent people coming together hand in hand.</p>
